/**
 * Centralized icon registry — re-exports all Lucide React icons used in this project.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { PlusIcon, SearchIcon } from '@/components/ui/icons';
 *
 * Add new icons here as they are introduced. Do NOT import directly from 'lucide-react'
 * in individual components — always import from this file so icon usage is tracked
 * in one place.
